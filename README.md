# WeatherFlow_PyConsole
Rasberry Pi Python console for WeatherFlow Smart Weather Station

## Update Instructions

Follow these instructions to update an existing installation of the WeatherFlow 
PyConsole. These instructions assume you have installed the PyConsole in the 
default directory (~/WeatherFlow/). If you have installed the PyConsole in a 
different location, I assume you know what you are doing!

**!!WARNING!!** - Updating the code will overwrite the WeatherFlow_PyConsole.ini 
configuration file. This is expected behaviour as I am likely to update it from 
time to time. Before running the update, I suggest you make a backup of your 
existing WeatherFlow_PyConsole.ini file so you can copy the relavent API keys 
back into the updated WeatherFlow_PyConsole.ini file.

```
cd ~/WeatherFlow/
wget https://api.github.com/repos/peted-davis/WeatherFlow_PyConsole/tarball -O PyConsole.tar.gz
tar -xvf PyConsole.tar.gz --strip 1
rm PyConsole.tar.gz
```

## Installation Instructions

Follow these instructions to setup a new installation of the WeatherFlow PyConsole on your
Raspberry Pi Official 7 inch touch screen. This initial installation should take ~1 hour.

The instructions assume you have already sucesfully setup your Raspberry Pi and 
installed Raspbian Stretch with Desktop, have attached the touch screen, and have 
either a keyboard and mouse attached directly to the Pi, or you can access the Pi 
through SSH/VNC. If you are starting from scratch, some of these links may help get 
you started:

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/

### Step 1: Make sure your Raspberry Pi is fully up to date

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### Step 2: Upgrade the Python 3 version of Pip

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```	

### Step 3: Confirm current user is in "input" and "video" groups

```
sudo usermod -a -G input,video $(whoami)
```

### Step 4: Install required dependencies

`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev python-setuptools libgstreamer1.0-dev git-core gstreamer1.0-plugins-{bad,base,good,ugly} gstreamer1.0-{omx,alsa} python-dev libmtdev-dev xclip xsel libatlas-base-dev`

```
y (confirms you want to install dependencies)
[press enter]
```

### Step 5: Install required Python modules

```
sudo python3 -m pip install autobahn[twisted] pytz pyasn1-modules service_identity geopy ephem Cython
```

### Step 6: Install Kivy Python library - this make take some time

```
sudo python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/kivy/kivy.git@master`
```

### Step 7: Configure Kivy for Raspberry Pi touchscreen

Run Kivy for the first time to generate configuration files:

```
python3 -c "import kivy"
```

Open file ".Kivy/config.ini" in Nano:

```
nano ~/.kivy/config.ini`
```

Delete everything in the [input] section. Add this:

```
mouse = mouse
mtdev_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=mtdev
hid_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=hidinput
```	

Save changes in Nano:

```
ctrl-x
y (confirms you want to save changes)
[press enter]
```

Reboot the system:

```
sudo reboot now
```

### Step 8: Download WeatherFlow PyConsole source code

```
cd && mkdir WeatherFlow && cd WeatherFlow
wget https://api.github.com/repos/peted-davis/WeatherFlow_PyConsole/tarball -O PyConsole.tar.gz
tar -xvf PyConsole.tar.gz --strip 1
rm PyConsole.tar.gz
```

### Step 9: Configure WeatherFlow PyConsole

To get the WeatherFlow PyConsole up and running, you need to specify your 
station number in the configuration file, as well as one API key needed to
determine the the station location (country) from its latitude/longitude, one 
needed to download an apppropriate weather forecast, and one needed to download 
the closest METAR information to your station location.

First, open the PyConsole .ini file:

```
nano WeatherFlowPyConsole.ini
```
	
Then, go to http://www.geonames.org/login and register for a new account. Once
you have registered, go to your account (http://www.geonames.org/manageaccount)
and activate "Free Web Services". Once this is done, type your username into the
'GeoNamesKey' variable in WeatherFlowPyConsole.ini. Do not enclose your username
in quotation marks!

Second, if you live in the UK go to the UK MetOffice DataPoint homepage
(https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint), and register for a new account. Copy
your API key into the 'MetOfficeKey' variable in WeatherFlowPyConsole.ini. Again
no quotation marks.

If you live outside the UK, leave the 'MetOfficeKey' variable blank and register
instead for a DarkSky API account (https://darksky.net/dev/register). Copy your
API key into the 'DarkSkyKey' variable.

Finally go to CheckWX Aviation Weather and register for a free API key that will
enable access to the closest METAR information to you station location.
(https://www.checkwx.com/signup). Copy your API key into the 'CheckWXKey' 
variable.  

You should now have a username in the 'GeoNamesKey' variable, an API key in
either the 'MetOfficeKey' variable if you live in the UK, or in the 'DarkSkyKey' 
variable if you live elsewhere, and an API key in the 'CheckWXKey' variable.
Next type your station ID into the 'StationID' variable. 

The console is designed to display data from the first Air and Sky module
it finds associated with your station. If you have multiple modules, write the 
names of the modules you wish to display in the 'AirName' and 'SkyName' 
variables. 

Leave the 'WFlowKey' as-is.

Save your changes in nano:

```
ctrl-x
y (confirms you want to save changes)
[press enter]
```
	
### Step 10: Run WeatherFlow PyConsole

Time to run the WeatherFlow PyConsole:

```
python3 main.py
```
